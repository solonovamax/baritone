# Installation

## Prebuilt official releases
These releases are not always completely up to date with latest features, and are only released from `master`. (so if you want `backfill-2` branch for example, you'll have to build it yourself)

Link to the releases page: [Releases](https://github.com/CodeF53/baritone/releases)

## Build it yourself
- Clone or download Baritone
